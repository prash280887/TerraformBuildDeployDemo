# Terms of Use - DRAFT PROPOSAL - FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY

## Usage

The Arthur J Gallagher (AJG) Company ChatGPT bot is exclusively authorized for use by AJG employees for professional business-related purposes.

## Training Data

The chatbot is powered by the Microsoft Azure OpenAI service. This service utilizes both GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 engines, ensuring state-of-the-art performance. It is trained with public datasets. Importantly, no proprietary or sensitive AJG data was used to train or fine-tune the service.

## Similarity of Content

Given the inherently variable nature of machine learning, posing the same question to the chatbot can result in different responses. These responses are dynamically generated based on the inquiry.

## Accuracy of Data

Artificial intelligence and machine learning are fields that are in constant flux, continually advancing and evolving. Due to the probabilistic algorithms that underpin machine learning, the bot may occasionally produce responses that are not entirely accurate. As such, it is essential that all outputs are subjected to human review to confirm their accuracy and relevance.

## Use of Content to Improve Services

Interactions with the chatbot are not utilized for the purpose of model training or enhancement.

## Logging of User Interactions

User engagement with the chatbot is securely documented. Log entries capture various details, including but not limited to, user ID, timing and duration of interaction, as well as chat prompts and their corresponding responses. Access to this log information is strictly limited to designated administrators. The recorded data is instrumental in monitoring usage patterns, evaluating bot performance, and ensuring compliance with governing policies and procedures.
